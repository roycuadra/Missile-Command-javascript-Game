# Basic Missile Command HTML and JavaScript Game
# [Live Demo](https://missile-command-kappa.vercel.app/)

This is a basic implementation of the Atari Missile Command game, but it's missing a few things intentionally and they're left as further exploration for the reader.

## Further Exploration

- Score
  - When a missile explodes (not a counter-missile), the score should increase by 25
  - At the end of the level the player should earn 5 bonus points for each missile still in a silo and 100 bonus points for each city still alive
  - See https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=306 Scoring section
- Bonus Targets
  - In each level there are bonus targets that move across the screen that award the player with additional points
- Limit Counter-missile fire rate
  - The player should only be able to fire 3 counter-missiles at a time
- Limit Missile city damage
  - The missiles should only be able to destroy 3 cities per level. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command#Gameplay
  
**Important note:** I will answer questions about the code but will not add more features or answer questions about adding more features. This series is meant to give a basic outline of the game but nothing more.
